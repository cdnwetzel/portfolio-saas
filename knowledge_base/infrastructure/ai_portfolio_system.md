# AI Portfolio Chat System — Architecture & Design

## At a Glance

Portfolio AI (dev.cwetzel.com) is a self-hosted, full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation platform serving a personalized digital twin of my work. It runs on a secure, low-latency hybrid-cloud topology: **Apache** on an edge VPS terminates SSL/WSS and proxies traffic through an encrypted **SSH reverse tunnel** to a bare-metal **Gentoo Linux** home server — zero cloud compute cost. Inference is served by **vLLM** running **Qwen2.5-Coder 14B Instruct** with **tensor parallelism across an NVLink-bridged dual RTX A4500** GPU array. A custom **FastAPI** backend manages a 24K-character sliding-window context history, streams tokens over **WebSocket**, and grounds every response in a **Qdrant** vector database — **bge-base-en-v1.5 (768-d) cosine retrieval, reranked by a bge-reranker-base CPU cross-encoder** — with an out-of-band faithfulness verifier independently scoring each answer's grounding.

## What This Is

The AI chat at dev.cwetzel.com is a full-stack AI inference system built on personal hardware. It's not a wrapper around OpenAI or a cloud GPU service — it runs on a Dell Precision T5810 in my home office on two RTX A4500 GPUs with a custom vLLM deployment.

The system demonstrates that high-quality AI inference can run on owned infrastructure at low cost, and that portfolio showcasing can be done with real engineering rather than polished demos.

**The code is open source:** https://github.com/cdnwetzel/portfolio-saas

If you're talking to this AI right now, you're using this system. The repo contains everything: the FastAPI proxy, the React frontend, the RAG pipeline, the Qdrant indexing scripts, and the vLLM service configuration.

---

## RAG Pipeline

Every chat message goes through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:

1. **Alias-expand query:** The user's message is widened with a curated synonym/alias map (e.g. "LLM" ↔ "large language model", project codenames) so retrieval recall doesn't depend on exact wording.
2. **Embed query:** The expanded query is embedded using `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768 dims, CPU).
3. **Hybrid search:** Qdrant runs a hybrid query against the `documents` collection — a dense (cosine) vector search **and** a BM25 sparse-term search — fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, returning the top-15 candidate chunks. Dense catches semantic matches; BM25 catches exact/rare terms (names, codenames, error strings) that dense embeddings miss.
4. **Rerank:** A `bge-reranker-base` cross-encoder (CPU, T5810) re-scores all 15 candidates against the original query and keeps the top 5 (capped at one chunk per source document for diversity). Runs on the T5810's idle CPU/RAM, no GPU contention with vLLM.
5. **Inject context:** The reranked top-5 chunks are fit to a token budget and injected into the LLM system prompt.
6. **Stream response:** vLLM streams the response token-by-token over WebSocket to the browser.
7. **Extract follow-ups:** The model appends `FOLLOWUPS:[...]` at the end; the frontend parses and strips it, showing suggestion chips.
8. **Verify (out-of-band):** After the answer is delivered, the proxy fire-and-forgets the `(query, answer, chunks)` to a faithfulness verifier on a separate box (asrock B550), which scores whether each claim is supported by the retrieved chunks. This never blocks or alters the answer — it's continuous drift monitoring (see "Verification & Validation" below).

This means the LLM is grounded in actual documented facts (my real projects, case studies, posts) rather than hallucinating biographical details — and the grounding is continuously *measured*, not just hoped for.

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base (indexed into Qdrant) includes:
- LinkedIn posts (top 10 by impressions, ~114K total impressions in 6 months)
- Case studies: SAP B1 global deployment, AVD 200-user migration, SOC2 Type II, disaster recovery
- Resume and professional context
- Infrastructure write-ups: T5810 homelab, this AI system
- Project docs: pxx (aider orchestrator), gentoo-machines (fleet config)

Documents are chunked structure-aware — split on markdown section boundaries (merging small sections, splitting long ones to ~400 words) so each chunk is a coherent semantic unit — then embedded (dense) and BM25-encoded (sparse) and stored as vectors.

---

## Why Qwen2.5-Coder 14B?

The model was chosen for:
- **14B parameters:** Fits both A4500s with tensor parallelism, leaves headroom for Qdrant + embeddings
- **Instruction-tuned:** Follows the system prompt grounding rules reliably
- **Code understanding:** Strong structured output (JSON for FOLLOWUPS), markdown formatting, technical accuracy
- **Speed:** Faster streaming than 32B models, perceptibly more responsive for portfolio demos

The `pscode` naming in the service reflects a past experiment with a LoRA adapter trained on Python code. The LoRA is NOT loaded in production — the base instruct model is used with RAG context instead of fine-tuning.

---

## WebSocket Architecture

The chat uses a WebSocket connection (not polling):

```
Browser → wss://dev.cwetzel.com/ws/chat
  FastAPI WebSocket handler
    → Qdrant search (top-15) → bge-reranker (top-5)
    → vLLM streaming (token by token)
    → Browser renders chunks as they arrive
```

This enables real-time streaming: tokens appear as fast as the model generates them. The frontend shows "Searching knowledge base…" during RAG, then transitions to streaming text.

---

## Security & Privacy

The threat model is intentionally small — scoping decisions remove most classic web-app risks by construction:

- **No user data, no PII.** The knowledge base holds only public portfolio content — resume, case studies, LinkedIn posts, infrastructure write-ups. There are no visitor accounts, no customer records, no personal data collected.
- **No authentication needed.** The chat serves read-only public information about my career. Nothing a visitor does writes to a database, so there are no logins, passwords, or user records to protect.
- **Queries are not logged or stored.** The proxy logs only metadata — retrieval counts, timing, grounding status — never the content of a visitor's question or the model's response. Per-session chat history lives in the browser's localStorage only; nothing is persisted server-side.
- **Backend isolation.** vLLM (8004), Qdrant (6333), the embedding service (8005), and the reranker (8006) all bind to localhost on the T5810 and have no internet-facing ports. The public VPS reaches them only over an SSH tunnel with key-based auth.
- **Transport security.** All browser traffic is HTTPS/WSS with Let's Encrypt certificates, terminated at Apache on the VPS; the VPS↔home link is SSH-encrypted.
- **Bounded inputs.** Inference requests are capped at a maximum prompt length to prevent resource-exhaustion abuse.

---

## Total Monthly Cost

- Cloud VPS (cwetzel.com): ~$20/month
- T5810 home server: owned hardware + electricity (~$30-40/month estimated)
- GPU compute: $0 cloud cost (owned A4500s)

Comparable cloud GPU inference (2× A4500 equivalent) would cost $3-5/hour. At moderate usage, owning the hardware pays off quickly and demonstrates the infrastructure competency directly.

---

## Engineering Decisions Worth Noting

**Persistent httpx client:** The FastAPI proxy uses a single `AsyncClient` via lifespan context rather than creating a new connection per request. This eliminates TCP handshake overhead on every RAG query.

**Grounding system prompt:** Low temperature + strict rules force the model to say "I don't have that documented" rather than hallucinate, and to ground every claim strictly in the retrieved KB documents (sources are shown to the visitor in a separate panel, so the prose stays clean). RAG context does the factual grounding; temperature handles response naturalness.

**FOLLOWUPS pattern:** Instead of a separate API call to generate follow-up questions, the model appends them in a structured block at the end of its response. The frontend regex-parses and strips them, showing chips without an extra round-trip.

**OpenRC not systemd:** The T5810 runs Gentoo with OpenRC. Service management uses `rc-service` and `rc-update` with environment files in `/etc/conf.d/`. For local testing, the FastAPI proxy is started manually with `uvicorn cloud.api-proxy:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`. A production OpenRC service for the proxy currently runs only on the Ubuntu VPS; the T5810 services (vLLM, Qdrant, embeddings, reranker) are managed under OpenRC.

**Why RAG over fine-tuning:** A LoRA adapter was previously trained on a Python code corpus as an experiment. It was a code-completion adapter, not biographical. For factual Q&A about my experience, RAG with structured KB documents gives more accurate, citable answers than fine-tuning on narrative text. The LoRA is not loaded in production.

**Why owned hardware over cloud GPU:** At moderate usage, an A4500 NVLink pair pays for itself in months vs. cloud GPU rental. More importantly, it's a portfolio signal in itself — the infrastructure is the demonstration.

## Model & Runtime Card

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Base model | Qwen2.5-Coder 14B Instruct |
| Model creator | Alibaba Cloud |
| Inference engine | vLLM 0.14.0 |
| Serving host | Dell Precision T5810, Gentoo Linux |
| GPU layout | 2× NVIDIA RTX A4500 20 GB, NVLink (40 GB aggregate) |
| Tensor parallelism | 2-way across the A4500 pair |
| Context window | 16,384 tokens |
| Reserved response budget | 2,048 tokens |
| Temperature | 0.35 |
| Top-p | 0.7 |
| Presence penalty | 0.5 |

### Speed (measured)

- **Generation throughput:** ~6 tokens/sec (BF16 14B, tensor-parallel on the A4500 pair). Measured ~48s for a 300-token answer.
- **Time to first token:** a few seconds — the RAG pre-step (embed → Qdrant search → CPU rerank) adds roughly 3–4s before the model starts, then prefill, then streaming begins.
- **End-to-end per query:** short answers/refusals land in ~7s; typical grounded answers run ~20–50s; long, detailed answers can reach ~100s. It's tuned for grounded quality on a single-user portfolio demo, not raw speed — the GPUs are the bottleneck and that's an accepted trade-off.

## Ports & Services

Home-server services bind to the LAN/localhost only. The public VPS reaches them through a single SSH reverse tunnel that terminates on the T5810; the T5810 in turn reaches the asrock box over the home LAN.

| Service | Port | Host | Role | Fallback if unavailable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FastAPI proxy | 8000 | VPS | WebSocket/API entry, RAG orchestration | None — chat stops |
| vLLM | 8004 | T5810 | LLM inference | None — chat stops |
| Qdrant | 6333 | T5810 | Hybrid vector + sparse search | None — chat stops |
| Embedding service | 8005 | T5810 | `bge-base-en-v1.5` query/document embeddings | None — chat stops |
| bge-reranker-base | 8006 | T5810 | Cross-encoder reranking of the top-15 candidates | Fused order, one chunk per source doc |
| Faithfulness verifier | 8007 | asrock B550 | Out-of-band claim-level faithfulness scoring | Chat unaffected — verdicts pause (fail-open) |
| SSH tunnel | 8004/6333/8005/8006/8007 forwarded | VPS → T5810 (→ asrock) | Secure VPS↔home link | None — services unreachable from public internet |

---

## Reranker Fallback Behavior

The proxy always retrieves 15 candidate chunks from Qdrant (hybrid dense + BM25). It then asks the CPU reranker (port 8006) to re-score all 15 and return the best ones. If the reranker is unreachable, returns a non-200 status, or times out, the proxy fails open: it uses the original fused order, applies the per-source-doc cap (max one chunk per document), and returns the top 5. Chat continues with slightly lower relevance precision.

---

## Verification & Validation

The system spans two home servers, reached over a single SSH tunnel. Here is how a question travels and how it gets checked:

```
Browser ──HTTPS/WSS──> cwetzel.com VPS (FastAPI proxy)
                          │  RAG: alias-expand → embed → Qdrant hybrid → rerank → vLLM stream
                          │  (all home services reached at 127.0.0.1 via the SSH tunnel)
                          ▼
                  ── SSH reverse tunnel ──> T5810 (ai.cwetzel.com)
                          ├─ vLLM 8004, Qdrant 6333, embed 8005, rerank 8006  (on the T5810)
                          └─ tunnel also forwards :8007 ──LAN──> asrock B550 (verifier)
```

**How the VPS reaches two home boxes through one tunnel.** The tunnel is a single SSH connection from the VPS that terminates on the T5810. Each forwarded port resolves its target *from the T5810's side*: ports 8004/6333/8005/8006 point at `127.0.0.1` (services on the T5810 itself), while port 8007 points at the asrock box's LAN address. So the T5810 doubles as the jump host — the VPS never needs a separate link to asrock; it rides the same tunnel, and the T5810 routes the verifier traffic across the home LAN. Nothing on either home server is exposed to the public internet.

**What the verifier does.** After every answer is delivered, the proxy fire-and-forgets `(question, answer, retrieved chunks)` to the verifier on asrock. A separate judge model (Qwen2.5-7B on CPU — deliberately a *different* model than the 14B that wrote the answer, to avoid self-grading bias) decides, per claim, whether it is **supported**, **unsupported**, or **contradicted** by the retrieved chunks, and records a faithfulness score. This is out-of-band: it never blocks, delays, or rewrites the answer, and if asrock is down the chat is completely unaffected (the verdict simply isn't recorded). It turns "the answer is grounded" from a hope into a continuously measured signal, and flags drift for review.

**Offline evaluation.** Separately from the live verifier, a graded eval harness (`scripts/eval_graded.py`) runs a ~30-question human-authored golden set through the live pipeline and scores grounding/faithfulness, with ship thresholds — the regression gate used before changes go live. A lightweight self-test also runs as a deploy gate and an hourly canary.

## Cost Comparison

| Cost item | Owned hardware | Equivalent cloud GPU |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud VPS (edge) | ~$20/month | ~$20/month |
| T5810 + 2× A4500 | Already owned; electricity ~$30–40/month | N/A |
| GPU inference | $0/hour | ~$3–5/hour for A4500-class GPU |
| 24/7 light usage | ~$50–60/month total | ~$2,200–3,600/month |
| One-time hardware | ~$2,500–3,500 (used/refurb) | $0 upfront |

At moderate usage, the owned hardware breaks even in roughly 1–2 months versus renting equivalent cloud GPU time. The main trade-off is operational responsibility: power, cooling, hardware failures, and tunnel maintenance.

## Known Limitations & Honest Weaknesses

1. **Answer-level, not claim-level, citations.** Every answer shows a collapsible "Sources" panel listing the exact KB chunks that grounded it (title, source, relevance score, snippet) — deterministic, from the actual retrieval. What it does not do is tie each individual sentence to a specific source; attribution is at the answer level.
2. **The chat's compute is a single point of failure.** The T5810 is one machine; a power, hardware, or ISP issue takes the chat offline until it recovers. (The asrock verifier is *not* a SPOF — it fails open, so the chat is unaffected if it's down.)
3. **No dynamic knowledge.** The KB is static Markdown. Recent work after the last index run isn't reflected until `scripts/index_with_embeddings.py` is re-run.
4. **Reranker and verifier run on CPU.** Each adds latency versus a GPU, but keeps GPU memory free for vLLM (and keeps the judge on a separate box entirely).
5. **Context window limits.** Long conversations are compacted by dropping oldest turns, so multi-turn threads can lose earlier context.
6. **The model can still hallucinate.** Grounding rules + hybrid retrieval reduce but don't eliminate it, especially with borderline-relevant chunks. The out-of-band verifier doesn't *prevent* a bad answer reaching the user once — it catches it afterward and flags it for the next iteration.

Addressed since earlier versions: upgraded embeddings (MiniLM-384 → bge-base-768), a graded eval pipeline + golden set, a deterministic prompt-extraction guardrail, a live faithfulness verifier, and a per-answer Sources panel in the UI. Still planned: claim-level (per-sentence) citation and automated re-indexing on KB changes.
