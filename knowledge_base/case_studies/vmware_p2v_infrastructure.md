# Case Study: VMware P2V Infrastructure Redesign (50+ Servers, Cost Reduction)

**Role:** Chris Wetzel — led this VMware P2V infrastructure redesign.

**Organization:** Mid-size technology company, 3 data center locations  
**Timeline:** 6 months (planning + P2V conversion + cutover)  
**Scope:** Migrate 50+ physical servers to virtual infrastructure across 3 sites  
**Challenge:** Minimize downtime, eliminate redundant hardware, reduce power/cooling costs  
**Outcome:** 60% hardware cost reduction, improved redundancy, faster disaster recovery  

---

## The Problem

The company had:
- 50+ physical servers across 3 locations (NYC, London, Singapore)
- Each server: dedicated hardware, single-use (file server, email, database, etc.)
- Power/cooling costs: $800k/year
- Hardware replacement: $200k/year
- Redundancy: Almost none (if one server fails, service goes down)

**The ask:** Consolidate to virtual infrastructure. Reduce costs. Improve redundancy.

## The Consolidation Strategy

### Physical Server Inventory

| Location | Servers | Power/Cooling | Annual Cost |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------|
| NYC | 20 | 50kW | $300k |
| London | 15 | 35kW | $250k |
| Singapore | 15 | 35kW | $250k |
| **Total** | **50** | **120kW** | **$800k/year** |

**Additional costs:**
- Hardware replacement (5-7 year lifespan): $200k/year
- Network uplinks (10Gbps per site): $100k/year
- Backup infrastructure: $50k/year
- **Total: $1.15M/year**

### Virtual Target Architecture

```
Each Location:
├─ Blade Server Enclosure (10 blade servers)
│  ├─ 2 Management blades (redundancy)
│  └─ 8 Compute blades (run VMs)
├─ SAN Storage (Fibre Channel)
│  ├─ 100TB fast (SSD tier, hot data)
│  ├─ 500TB medium (SAS tier, warm data)
│  └─ 1TB slow (NL-SAS tier, archive)
├─ Network
│  ├─ 10Gbps uplinks (2 per site, redundant)
│  ├─ iSCSI for VM storage
│  └─ Fibre Channel for SAN
└─ vCenter Management
   └─ Centralized view across all 3 sites
```

## The P2V Process (Physical to Virtual)

### Phase 1: Assessment (Month 1)

For each physical server:
1. **Assess CPU needs:** Peak load, burst capacity
2. **Assess memory:** Working set size
3. **Assess storage:** Current size + growth rate
4. **Assess network:** Peak throughput

**Result:** Mapping table
```
Server Name    | CPU | RAM | Storage | Network | VM Type
file1.corp     | 2   | 4GB | 500GB   | 1Gbps   | small
db-prod        | 8   | 32GB| 2TB     | 10Gbps  | xlarge
mail.corp      | 4   | 8GB | 1TB     | 5Gbps   | medium
```

### Phase 2: P2V Conversion (Month 2-3)

**Conversion Process:**

1. **Create VM template** (matching physical specs)
2. **Physical → Virtual:** Use P2V tool (VMware Converter) to clone physical disk to VM
3. **Boot VM:** Verify it starts
4. **Test services:** Confirm application works
5. **Performance baseline:** Measure CPU, memory, disk I/O
6. **Compare to physical:** Is VM as fast? Faster? Slower?
7. **Optimize:** Adjust VM resources if needed
8. **Schedule cutover:** Plan zero-downtime switch

**Zero-Downtime Cutover:**
- Physical server: Stop services
- Backup final data state
- VM startup with latest data
- DNS/IP routing points to VM
- Old physical server: Offline (keep for 30 days as rollback)

### Phase 3: Consolidation (Month 4-5)

**Consolidation ratio: 50 physical → 25 VMs running on 8-10 blade servers**

How?
- Blade 1: 3 web servers (apache, nginx, node.js)
- Blade 2: 4 application servers (Java, .NET)
- Blade 3: 2 database servers (PostgreSQL, MSSQL)
- Blade 4: 3 file servers (NFS, SMB)
- Blade 5: 2 email servers (Exchange)
- Blade 6-7: 2-3 VMs each (specialized, dev/test)
- Blade 8-10: Spare capacity + HA pairs

**Why consolidation works:**
- Physical file server: Used 10% CPU most of the time. Waste = 90%.
- Virtual: 5-10 VMs per blade server. Average utilization: 60-70%.

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: SAN Storage (Not Direct Attached)

**Option A: Direct-attached storage (DAS)**
- Pro: Fast (local disk, no network hop)
- Con: Single point of failure (if blade dies, storage dies)
- Con: No live migration (can't move VM between blades)

**Option B: SAN Storage (Fibre Channel)**
- Cost: Higher ($200k vs $50k)
- Benefit: Live migration (move VM between blades, no downtime)
- Benefit: Redundancy (storage is shared, blade failure doesn't lose data)
- Benefit: Snapshots (backup entire VM in seconds)

**Decision:** SAN. The ability to migrate live and snapshot is worth the cost.

**Live Migration Example:**
- Blade 3 getting replaced (hardware refresh)
- VM on Blade 3 needs to move
- vMotion: Move VM to Blade 4 while running (users don't notice)
- Old blade can now go offline for maintenance
- Zero downtime

### Decision 2: Tiered Storage (Hot/Warm/Cold)

**All storage on one tier (SSD):**
- Cost: $500/TB × 1TB = $500k
- Pro: Everything fast
- Con: Expensive

**Tiered Storage:**
- Hot (SSD): 100TB for active databases, web servers = $50k
- Warm (SAS): 500TB for archives, backups, old data = $100k
- Cold (NL-SAS): 1TB for long-term archive = $20k
- Total: $170k

**How it works:**
- Recently accessed data: Auto-moves to SSD (fast)
- Old data: Auto-moves to slower tiers (cheap)
- Users don't care (they access what they need, it's already fast)

**Savings:** $330k per location × 3 = **$990k for 3 sites**

### Decision 3: Network Redundancy (2 Uplinks, Not 1)

Each site has:
- 2 × 10Gbps uplinks to corporate backbone
- If 1 fails, traffic fails over to other (2 seconds)
- Sites are geographically distributed (NYC ↔ London ↔ Singapore)

**Cost:** Extra switch, extra fiber = $50k per site  
**Benefit:** Never a network outage (unless both fail simultaneously, which is rare)

### Decision 4: vCenter Centralized Management

All 3 sites managed from one console:
- View all VMs across all 3 locations
- Migrate VMs between sites (if needed)
- Snapshot management
- Disaster recovery (failover between sites)

**Cost:** $100k vCenter license + $20k/year support  
**Benefit:** One person can manage all 3 sites instead of 3 people managing 1 site each

## Results Achieved

### Cost Reduction

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Physical servers | 50 | 0 | -100% |
| Virtual machines | 0 | 25-30 | New |
| Data centers | 3 | 3 | Same |
| Power consumption | 120kW | 40kW | -67% |
| Annual opex | $1.15M | $420k | -63% |
| Disaster recovery time | 1-2 days | 4-6 hours | 4-6x faster |
| Server refresh cycle | 5 years | On-demand | Instant |

### Operational Improvements

- **Live migration:** Move VMs between blades without downtime
- **Snapshots:** Full VM backup in seconds
- **Rapid recovery:** Restore from snapshot (VM up in 2 minutes)
- **Scaling:** Add new VMs instantly (no hardware refresh)
- **Redundancy:** Single blade failure doesn't bring down services

### Lessons Learned

#### Lesson 1: Consolidation Ratio is Conservative
We planned for 2.5 VMs per physical server. Actual: 5-10 VMs per blade server, with 60-70% utilization.

**Why:** Physical servers are huge (quad-core, 32GB RAM, 2TB storage), but most run at 10-20% utilization. VMs right-size to actual need.

#### Lesson 2: SAN Storage Enables Disaster Recovery
Before: If a data center failed, we manually restored from tape (8+ hours).
After: Replicate SAN to another site. Fail over in minutes.

**Cost:** Worth every penny.

#### Lesson 3: Live Migration Changes the Game
Before: Blade server needed maintenance → take that service down.
After: Live-migrate VM to another blade → no downtime.

**Impact:** Doubled agility. Infrastructure changes never impact users.

#### Lesson 4: Tiered Storage Requires Automation
Manual: "Move old data to slow tier" = tedious and easy to mess up.
Auto: VMware Storage vMotion automatically moves data based on access patterns.

**Benefit:** Users always get fast access. Old data automatically moves to cheap storage.

## How It Applies to Your Work

If you're managing physical infrastructure:

- **Consolidate before scaling:** 50 servers → 25 VMs is way more manageable
- **SAN storage enables mobility:** VMs are cattle, not pets
- **Tiered storage saves 70%:** Don't put everything on fast disks
- **Live migration is game-changing:** Infrastructure changes = zero downtime
- **Centralized management scales:** 1 person can now manage 50 VMs across 3 sites

The investment ($1.15M) paid back in 1.6 years. Then $730k/year savings forever. And they got 4-6x faster disaster recovery as a bonus.
