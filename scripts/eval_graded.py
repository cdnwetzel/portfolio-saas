"""
Graded, multi-signal RAG eval (rag-improvements.md §1.1 / verifier plan §12).

Goes beyond the boolean grounded-vs-fallback gate in selftest.py: runs the golden
set, captures per-question PROGRAMMATIC signals (refusal / substantive / citation /
PII-leak / prompt-leak / expected-substring), optionally scores 1-5 with an
INDEPENDENT judge model, stamps the prompt_version on every record, and writes JSONL
for trend tracking. Exits non-zero if ship thresholds aren't met (so it can gate).

Key design points (hard-won, see plan §12):
  * The judge MUST be a different model than the one that wrote the answer (the 14B),
    or you get echo bias — a single same-family judge penalizes assertive answers
    and can grade a MORE faithful version WORSE (firm review mon:bl89). Point
    --judge-url at a different endpoint/model. The harness warns if it looks like
    the 14B, and falls back to programmatic-only scoring when no judge is given.
  * The golden set (human-authored) is the backstop; LLM convergence alone is not
    sign-off (mon:bl278).

Dependencies: websockets (already needed by selftest), PyYAML. The judge call uses
stdlib urllib so no extra HTTP dep is required.

Reaching the judge: the 7B judge is served by Ollama on the verifier box, bound to that box's
localhost (port 11434). Port 8007 is the verifier's own FastAPI service — it speaks /verify, NOT
/v1/chat/completions, so pointing --judge-url at it will not work. From a workstation, forward
Ollama over the jump host, and pick a LOCAL port that is not already serving your own Ollama —
otherwise you will silently grade against the wrong model and call it a baseline:

    ssh -f -N -J root@ai.cwetzel.com -L 11500:127.0.0.1:11434 chris@<verifier-host>

Usage:
