repo_to_kb.py — Generate a portfolio KB doc from a repo using the local LoRA.

Strategy: README-first map-reduce. README gets its own dedicated extract pass
(it is the authoritative source). All other docs are chunked and extracted as
supporting context. Facts are labeled PRIMARY vs SUPPORTING so the synthesize
step knows what to trust when details conflict.

README_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are extracting facts from the README of a software repository for a professional portfolio KB.
The README is the PRIMARY source — extract every concrete detail. Miss nothing.

Work through this checklist explicitly:

PROJECT IDENTITY
- Project name, one-line description
- Version number and current status (alpha/beta/stable/v1.0 etc.)
- Package registry name and exact install command (PyPI, npm, crates.io, etc.)
- GitHub URL
- Any separately installable sub-packages or standalone components

CLI COMMANDS & FLAGS — list every one found, including:
- Default invocation and what it does
- Edit/write modes and their flags
- Autonomous, batch, or long-running modes and their flags
- Diagnostic, health-check, or self-test commands and their flags
- Any interactive/in-session commands (slash commands, REPL verbs, etc.)
- Flags that pass through to underlying tools

ARCHITECTURE — extract specifically:
- Each named component and what it does
- Port numbers for every service
- File paths and config file locations
- The process/concurrency model and any handoff pattern (exec, subprocess, fork, async workers, etc.)
- Data flow: what goes in, what comes out, where it goes next
- What runs locally vs remotely

DESIGN DECISIONS — why each architectural choice was made:
- Why a particular process/concurrency model was chosen
- Why fail-closed vs fail-open
- Why local vs cloud
- Any "deliberate" or "intentional" design choices with stated reasons

STANDALONE COMPONENTS
- Any sub-package or component installable independently
- Services that can run standalone

TEST SUITE
- The count from the project's OWN test runner (label as "project test suite")
- Do NOT count install verification tests as the project test suite
- If multiple counts appear, list each with its source

NAMED OPTIMIZATIONS & ALGORITHMS
- Cache layers and their measured speedup
- Search/retrieval algorithms and their named parameters
- Performance figures (latency, throughput, dataset size benchmarks)

MULTI-TOOL OR MULTI-MODEL PATTERNS
- Parallel processing setups (multiple tools or workers running simultaneously)
- Multi-model routing or fallback chains
- Named external tools the project orchestrates

ENVIRONMENT & CONFIG
- Every environment variable name and default value
- Config file locations
- Override mechanisms

Repository: {repo_url}

README content:
---
{content}

Extract every fact found. One fact per line. Group by the checklist categories above.
Mark any metric that is a goal/target (not yet measured) with "(target)".
Mark install verification test counts with "(install check, not project test suite)":"""

# Supporting docs get a thorough but briefer extract
SUPPORTING_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are extracting facts from part {chunk_num} of {total_chunks} of the supporting documentation
for a software repository. These facts supplement the README.

Look specifically for anything NOT typically in a README:
- Internal architecture details, file paths, class/function names
- Engineering decisions with reasons (why X was chosen over Y)
- Lessons learned, what broke, what was surprising
- CLI commands or features not documented in README
- Test counts from the project's own test runner (NOT install verification counts)
- Named sub-features with implementation specifics (cache hit rates, algorithm parameters)
- Multi-tool or multi-process patterns (parallel workers, concurrent calls)
- Standalone installable sub-packages

SYNTHESIZE_PROMPT = """You are writing a professional portfolio knowledge base document for Chris Wetzel.
This will be read by recruiters, collaborators, and clients asking about his engineering projects.
Getting the facts right matters — this represents his career and skills.

Facts are labeled [PRIMARY] (from README — highest confidence) or [SUPPORTING] (from other docs).
Rules for conflicts:
- Prefer [PRIMARY] facts over [SUPPORTING] facts
- For test counts: use the count from the project's OWN test runner, NOT from install verification
- If a [PRIMARY] fact and [SUPPORTING] fact conflict, use [PRIMARY] and note the discrepancy only if significant

Frame this as a personal engineering project that demonstrates technical depth.
Chris Wetzel is a senior IT/infrastructure professional — not a student, not a contractor billing hours.

Write the KB doc with EXACTLY these sections and headers:

# <Project Name> — <one-line description, 10 words max>

## What It Is
2-3 sentences. What it does, current version/status, where it runs. Concrete facts only.

## What Problem It Solves
The real motivation behind building it. Specific pain point, not generic "improves workflow."

## Architecture
How it actually works: components, data flow, key interfaces. Include port numbers, file paths,
and the process/concurrency model with any handoff pattern. Show the actual flow.

## Key Features
Specific capabilities with concrete details. Include:
- Named modes and commands (autonomous, diagnostic, dogfooding)
- Named algorithms with their parameters
- Interactive/in-session commands
- Multi-tool or multi-model patterns

## Engineering Quality
Test count (from project's own test runner — not install verification), tooling choices,
notable discipline decisions and the reason behind each.

## Tech Stack
Clean bullet list: language/version, key libraries, infrastructure components with roles.

## What I Learned Building This
Non-obvious insights. Hard-won lessons. What broke and what that revealed. What he'd do differently.
Specific, not generic. Each point should be something a reader couldn't have guessed.

Strict rules:
- Use ONLY facts from the extracted lists below. Do not invent or infer details.
- Write in third person: "Chris built...", "the project uses...", "it ships..."
- No vague adjectives ("robust", "scalable", "powerful") — replace with specifics.
- Dense over verbose. Every sentence earns its place with a searchable fact.
- Use measured/observed values not targets. Do not report planned future counts as current facts.
- Stop after ## What I Learned Building This. No closing commentary, no meta-notes.
