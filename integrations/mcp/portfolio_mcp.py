Portfolio-RAG MCP server — exposes cwdotcom's GROUNDED retrieval to an MCP client
(OpenClaw's `mcporter` skill on the Mac Mini) so a WhatsApp/agent front-end can answer
questions about Chris Wetzel's work WITHOUT hallucinating. See plans/openclaw-portfolio-rag.md.

Design: a thin, READ-ONLY facade over cwdotcom's existing stack. Direction is one-way —
OpenClaw depends on cwdotcom, never the reverse. No new business logic; no writes.

Tools:
  portfolio_answer(question)                 → the SAFE default. Drives cwdotcom's full
      hardened pipeline via the public WS (reusing run_diagnostic_battery.ask): grounding
      system prompt, prompt-extraction guardrail, dense retrieval + rerank, out-of-band
      verifier (fires server-side), FOLLOWUPS. Returns {answer, sources}. Zero proxy change.
  portfolio_search(question, k=5)            → raw grounded chunks via cwdotcom's /api/retrieve
      seam (embed → dense search → rerank → per-doc cap, server-side) for an agent to reason over.
  portfolio_verify(question, answer, chunks) → faithfulness check via the asrock judge.

The tool LOGIC lives in plain async functions (importable/testable with no `mcp` dep). The
MCP transport is a guarded wrapper so this file imports fine for tests even without the SDK.

Env:
  CWDOTCOM_WS_URL        default wss://dev.cwetzel.com/ws/chat        (portfolio_answer)
  CWDOTCOM_RETRIEVE_URL  default https://dev.cwetzel.com/api/retrieve (portfolio_search)
  VERIFIER_URL           REQUIRED for portfolio_verify — no default.  (e.g. http://<judge-host>:8007)
                         The judge is a LAN-only service, so its address is deployment-specific
                         and is not committed here. Set it in the MCP server's env. Without it,
                         portfolio_verify reports unconfigured; portfolio_answer is unaffected.
