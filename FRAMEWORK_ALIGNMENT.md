## GATE 1: Planning ⏳ READY TO BEGIN

### Deliverables (Must Create Before GATE 2)

| Document | Template Path | Owner | Effort | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| **prd.md** | `psplan/templates/requirements/prd.md` | Requirements Analyst | 4 hours | 🔲 Not Started |
| **architecture.md** | `psplan/templates/technical/architecture.md` | Tech Architect | 6 hours | 🔲 Not Started |
| **test-plan.md** | `psplan/templates/execution/test-plan.md` | QA Engineer | 4 hours | 🔲 Not Started |
| **.cursorrules** | `psplan/templates/rules/cursorrules.md` | Tech Architect | 2 hours | 🔲 Not Started |

### Key Design Decisions Needed

**From GATE 1 planning:**

1. **Model Selection**
   - [ ] Confirm: Llama 2 70B (vs. alternatives like Mistral, Qwen)
   - [ ] Quantization strategy: float16 vs. bfloat16 vs. int8
   - [ ] Context window: 4096 vs. 8192 vs. 16384

2. **Data Architecture**
   - [ ] Qdrant persistence: in-memory vs. disk vs. cloud
   - [ ] Vector embedding model: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (confirmed)
   - [ ] Data chunking strategy: chunk_size, overlap

3. **API Design**
   - [ ] Streaming response format (SSE vs. WebSocket)
   - [ ] Pagination + pagination cursor strategy
   - [ ] Error response envelope (standardized vs. per-endpoint)

4. **Scalability**
   - [ ] Max concurrent requests: target is 32–64
   - [ ] Batching strategy: how many requests per batch?
   - [ ] Request queue size: overflow behavior

5. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Key metrics: latency, throughput, error rate, cost
   - [ ] Alert thresholds (e.g., p99 latency > 500ms)
   - [ ] Dashboard: Grafana vs. simple Prometheus?

## Document Alignment (Current vs. Framework)

### What's Already in Place

✅ **CLAUDE.md**
- Current Status ✅
- Vision & Strategy ✅
- Requirements overview ✅
- Technical blueprint ✅
- Execution & Quality (partial)
- Governance & Compliance ✅

✅ **docs/ folder**
- 01-architecture.md (detailed, but not structured for framework)
- 02-backend-setup.md (implementation guide, not PRD)
- 03-frontend-setup.md (technical, not PRD)
- 04-infrastructure.md (good, aligns with deployment)
- 05-deployment.md (operational, aligns with DEPLOYMENT.md)
- 06-billing.md (feature docs, will feed into PRD)
- 07-checklist.md (helpful but not framework-aligned)

### What Needs to Be Restructured

The detailed docs/ files are **too implementation-focused** and should be reorganized:

**Current structure:**
```
docs/
├── 01-architecture.md        ← Implementation details
├── 02-backend-setup.md       ← Code setup, not requirements
├── 03-frontend-setup.md      ← Code setup, not requirements
```

**Framework-aligned structure:**
```
docs/
├── 01-prd.md                 ← GATE 1: Product requirements
├── 02-architecture.md        ← GATE 1: Technical design (will replace current)
├── 03-test-plan.md           ← GATE 1: Testing strategy
├── 04-model-card.md          ← GATE 3: Model limitations
├── 05-code-review-checklist.md ← GATE 3: Review criteria
├── 06-deployment.md          ← GATE 4: Deployment runbook
├── 07-incident-playbook.md   ← GATE 4: Incident response
└── 08-lessons-learned.md     ← GATE 5: Retrospective
```

## Quality Standards (psplan Baseline)

### Code Standards (Enforced in .cursorrules)

| Standard | Target | How |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Type Hints | 90%+ coverage | `mypy --strict src/` |
| Test Coverage | 80%+ | `pytest --cov=src tests/` |
| Docstrings | Public functions only | 1-line for simple, multi-line for complex |
| Linting | Zero issues | `ruff check src/` |
| Security | OWASP Top 10 | Manual audit + code review |

### Documentation Standards

| Document | Update Trigger | Audience |
|----------|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md | After every gate transition | Tech lead, all roles |
| README.md | After code change | Developers |
| architecture.md | If design changes | Architects, developers |
| DEPLOYMENT.md | If deployment changes | DevOps, on-call |
| Test results | After GATE 3 completion | QA, all roles |

## Risk Assessment Against Framework

### Alignment Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Framework documents may diverge from code | High | Update CLAUDE.md after every gate + quarterly review |
| .cursorrules not enforced during development | Medium | Pre-commit hook checks; code review enforces |
| GATE gates skipped (jump to GATE 2) | Medium | Require explicit gate approval before proceeding |
| Invariants not validated in CI/CD | Medium | Add `release_checklist.sh` to GitHub Actions |

### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Weekly alignment check** (first Monday of each week)
   - CLAUDE.md reflects current status
   - Invariants validation passes
   - Red-lines not violated

2. **Gate transition ceremony** (before each gate)
   - Checklist reviewed by team
   - Sign-offs obtained
   - Go/No-Go decision documented

3. **Monthly governance review**
   - Red-lines still relevant?
   - Invariants still measurable?
   - Lessons learned captured?

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Project teams should read first:**
   - `/Users/cwetzel/ai/psaios/psplan/README.md` (overview)
   - `/Users/cwetzel/ai/psaios/psplan/PHILOSOPHY.md` (principles)
   - `/Users/cwetzel/ai/psaios/psplan/PYTHON_ML_WORKFLOW_INDEX.md` (this framework)

2. **For this project specifically:**
   - `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` (scope + team)
   - `vision.md` (success metrics)
   - `red-lines.md` (what NOT to do)
   - `invariants.md` (what MUST be true)

3. **When ready for GATE 1:**
   - `/Users/cwetzel/ai/psaios/psplan/templates/python-ml-project-blueprint.md` (GATE 1 section)
   - `prd.md` (to be created)
   - `architecture.md` (to be created)

---

## Questions for GATE 1 Planning

Before proceeding, clarify:

1. **Model selection:** Llama 70B locked in, or revisit (Mistral, Qwen)?
2. **Deployment timeline:** Hard deadline July 6, or flexible?
3. **Revenue requirement:** Must be Stripe-integrated + revenue-tracking, or MVP without billing?
4. **Monitoring setup:** Full Prometheus + Grafana, or simple logging?
5. **Onboarding:** Build admin panel, or manage users manually initially?

---

## Approval Workflow

### GATE 0 → GATE 1 Approval

**Go/No-Go Decision:**

- [ ] No red-line violations identified
- [ ] Stakeholder (Chris) agrees on success metrics
- [ ] Tech lead (Chris) confirms timeline realistic

**Decision: ☐ GO to GATE 1  ☐ HOLD  ☐ CANCEL**
