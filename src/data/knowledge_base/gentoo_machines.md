# gentoo-machines — Multi-Machine Gentoo Configuration Repo

## What It Is

`gentoo-machines` is my personal infrastructure-as-code repository for managing a fleet of Gentoo Linux machines. Every machine in my homelab has a dedicated directory with hardware-specific kernel configuration, build profile, and documented reasoning for every non-obvious choice.

**Repo:** https://github.com/cdnwetzel/gentoo-machines  
*(Private — contains hardware-specific config; excerpts shared on LinkedIn)*

## The Problem It Solves

Gentoo's power is also its problem: every machine can be configured perfectly for its hardware, but "perfectly configured" is easy to lose track of across multiple machines. `gentoo-machines` is the answer — a version-controlled record of what's running, why, and how to reproduce it.

Machines don't drift silently because changes are committed. If I rebuild the T5810 after a hardware failure, the kernel config is in git.

## Machine Fleet

| Machine | Hardware | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **T5810** | Dell Precision, 2× RTX A4500 (NVLink), Xeon E5-2697 | Active — AI inference (vLLM), primary GPU server |
| **OptiPlex 3090 SFF** | Dell OptiPlex 3090 SFF, RTX A1000 (8GB) | Active — secondary GPU workstation |
| **AMD build** | Custom, Ryzen 9 5950X (Zen 3), 16-core | Active — heavy compile workloads |
| **Dell XPS 15 9510** | Intel Core i7-11800H (Tiger Lake H) | Active — dev laptop |
| **Beelink MINI S** | Intel mini PC | Active — low-power always-on tasks |
| **Surface Pro 6** | Intel 8th-gen | Active — portable dev |
| **NUC 11** | Intel i5 NUC 11 | Profiled (kernel_config.sh documented); OS not installed |
| **Surface Pro 9** | Intel Core i7-1255U | Profiled; not built |

All running machines use Gentoo Linux with OpenRC (not systemd). Custom kernels compiled per-machine.

## kernel_config.sh Design

Each `kernel_config.sh` is a shell script that documents kernel options with **explanations**, not just values. The comment answers "why is this option set?" rather than repeating what the option does.

Example pattern (T5810):
```bash
# NVIDIA NVLink — required for tensor-parallel vLLM across both A4500s
# Without this, CUDA sees two isolated GPUs, not a NVLink pair
CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU=n         # Disable nouveau; use proprietary nvidia driver
CONFIG_MODULES=y              # Modules required for nvidia.ko loading
```

This prevents cargo-cult configuration: future me (or anyone else reading the repo) knows *why* each option exists and can make informed decisions when kernel versions change or hardware gets replaced.

## T5810 Kernel Config — Notable Choices

The T5810 is the most complex machine in the fleet due to the AI inference workload:

- **NVLink enabled:** Allows the two A4500s to share memory and operate as a single tensor-parallel unit (required for vLLM TP=2)
- **Nouveau disabled:** Proprietary NVIDIA driver handles NVLink; nouveau doesn't support it
- **IOMMU enabled:** For clean GPU memory isolation
- **CUDA device support:** `nvidia.ko` loads at boot for immediate GPU availability
- **Memory overcommit tuned:** For large model weights (13.94 GiB per GPU)
- **OpenRC init:** Not systemd — Gentoo's OpenRC gives precise control over service start order (vLLM must start after CUDA module load and after network is up for SSH tunnel)

## Tools Directory — Fleet Automation

The `tools/` directory is where most of the engineering work lives. These aren't one-off scripts — they're a coordinated toolkit for managing Gentoo across diverse hardware without drift.

**`kconfig-lint.sh`** — Static kernel config validator. Checks `kernel_config.sh` files for ~19,000 kernel symbols across 5 error classes (dangerous combinations, missing dependencies, conflicting options). Runs before any kernel compile to catch mistakes before they cause boot failures.

**`harvest.sh`** — Hardware discovery tool. Interrogates the running system across 15 categories (PCI devices, USB, ACPI, CPU features, memory config, storage layout, network interfaces, etc.) and emits a structured hardware inventory. Used to bootstrap `kernel_config.sh` for a new machine and to verify hardware detection after kernel changes.

**`kernel-config-template.sh`** — Auto-generates a starting `kernel_config.sh` from `harvest.sh` output. Takes raw hardware discovery and produces a documented template with options pre-filled and rationale stubs for human editing. Reduces time-to-correct-kernel from hours to under 30 minutes on new hardware.

**`generate-install.sh`** — Creates three-phase automated Gentoo install scripts (bootstrap, base system, machine-specific) with machine-specific feature gates. Each phase is idempotent and resumable. Turns a fresh disk into a running Gentoo install with correct kernel in ~2 hours.

**`verify-install.sh`** — Post-reboot deep verification across 8 sections (kernel, hardware detection, services, network, storage, GPU, audio, power). Auto-detects which machine it's running on and applies the appropriate verification checklist. Exits with a structured pass/fail report.

**`build-kernel-remote.sh`** — Cross-compilation and SSH-based kernel deployment. Build the kernel for a constrained machine (Beelink, NUC) on a powerful host (AMD build or T5810), then transfer and install via SSH. Critical for machines where native compilation would take hours or overwhelm the thermal envelope.

**`update-system.sh`** — Coordinated update script for running `emerge --update @world` across machines with:
- Dependency pre-resolution (checks before committing)
- Kernel recompile + automated smoke test after kernel updates
- Service restart orchestration with health checks
- Rollback procedure (previous kernel preserved in `/boot/`)
- Audit log of every update run (used for compliance reference)

The script is conservative: it would rather abort and ask than attempt to resolve a USE flag conflict silently.

## Surface Pro 6 Kernel Notes

The Surface requires several out-of-tree patches and non-obvious options:
- `SURFACE_AGGREGATOR`: The Surface Aggregator Module is required for battery, keyboard, and many hardware features — not mainlined in all kernels
- **WiFi driver**: Intel wireless card requires specific firmware; easy to miss during kernel compilation
- **Suspend/resume**: S3 sleep has quirks on Surface hardware; workaround committed to notes.md
- Surface Pro 9 was profiled (hardware documented, kernel_config.sh written) but Gentoo was not installed on it

The Surface is a good example of why per-machine kernel configs matter: a generic kernel that works fine on server hardware will fail silently on Surface (WiFi appears to work until first suspend cycle, then dies).

---

## Philosophy

**Hardware-aware, not one-size-fits-all.** The same USE flag that speeds up the T5810's compilation (multithreaded GPU work) wastes memory on the NUC8i7 (passive cooling, lower TDP). The configs reflect the actual use case of each machine, not a shared template.

**Documentation through code.** Comments in kernel_config.sh answer why, not what. "CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU=n" is self-documenting; "*# Required for NVLink tensor parallelism — nouveau doesn't support NVLink SLI*" is what you actually need after a year away from the config.

**Version control as memory.** Every kernel change is committed. When something breaks, `git bisect` on kernel configs is surprisingly effective.
