# Security Hardening & Continuous Testing: Operational Controls

## Overview

Security hardening is not a one-time configuration. It's an **operational discipline** combining:
- **Proactive configuration hardening** (disable weak protocols, remove defaults)
- **Active patching** (timely updates to close vulnerabilities)
- **Continuous testing** (monthly internal pen tests, external cadence 3-12 months)
- **Corrective action workflows** (find issue → fix → verify → document)
- **Principle of least privilege** (every access, every port, every setting justified)

This framework applies across compliance regimes: SOC2 Type II, PCI DSS 4.0, HIPAA, NIST 171, FINRA. The controls overlap; the philosophy is unified.

## Core Hardening Controls

### TLS/SSL Encryption

**Control:** All data in transit is encrypted with strong cryptography

**Implementation:**
- **Minimum TLS 1.2**, preferred 1.3
- **Disabled weak protocols:** SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 (legacy systems only with compensating controls)
- **Cipher suite configuration:** Enforce only strong ciphers
  - ✓ Allowed: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305
  - ✗ Blocked: DES, RC4, MD5, anon (anonymous key exchange)
- **Certificate management:**
  - Valid certificate for every domain
  - Certificates renewed before expiration (monitored with alerts at 30 days, 14 days, 7 days)
  - Certificate pinning for sensitive APIs (prevent MITM via compromised CAs)
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Enabled on all web applications
  - Header: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
  - Forces browsers to HTTPS-only for 1 year
  - Prevents downgrade attacks

**Evidence auditors check:**
- Current certificate details (validity, issuance, renewal schedule)
- Cipher suite configuration (screenshot/config file)
- TLS version enforcement (SSL Labs test or similar)
- HSTS header presence (browser developer tools)
- Certificate renewal logs (evidence of proactive renewal before expiration)

**Common finding in testing:**
```
Vulnerability: TLS 1.0 still enabled on legacy system
Root cause: System was installed in 2015, not updated
Corrective action:
  1. Assessed risk: Is this system exposed to untrusted networks? (Yes)
  2. Evaluated options: Upgrade OS? Disable TLS 1.0 and require external access via proxy?
  3. Decision: Deploy reverse proxy (nginx) in front of legacy system
  4. Proxy terminates TLS 1.2, forwards to legacy system on internal network
  5. Tested: External scan shows TLS 1.2 only, internal communication unaffected
  6. Verified: In next month's pen test, no weak TLS detected
```

### Certificate Management & Currency

**Control:** All certificates are valid, current, and monitored

**Process:**
- Inventory of all certificates (where they're used, when they expire)
- Monitoring: automated alerts at 30 days, 14 days, 7 days before expiration
- Renewal: initiated before expiration (usually 60-90 days out)
- Verification: new certificate tested in staging before production deployment
- Documentation: renewal logs showing old cert → new cert transition

**Example timeline:**
```
Certificate for api.example.com
Issued: 2024-01-15, Expires: 2025-01-14 (1-year validity)

2024-10-15 (90 days before expiration): Automated alert "cert expires in 90 days"
  → Check: Renewal policy allows 60 days, so we're in window
  → Renewal requested from CA

2024-12-15 (30 days before expiration): Alert "cert expires in 30 days"
  → Verify: New certificate received? Yes
  → Test: New cert deployed to staging, validated with SSL Labs
  → Schedule: Production deployment for 2024-12-20 (off-peak window)

2024-12-20: Production certificate update
  → Deploy new certificate to load balancer
  → Verify: Traffic flows without SSL errors
  → Confirm: Certificate chain is complete and valid
  → Log: "Certificate updated: api.example.com, old cert 2024-01-15, new cert 2025-01-14"

2025-01-15: Old certificate expires (no impact, already replaced)
```

### Exposed Management Interfaces

**Control:** Administrative interfaces are not exposed to the internet

**What "exposed" means:**
- Accessible from untrusted networks without authentication
- Default credentials still enabled
- On standard ports (8080, 8000, 3000, 3389, 22)
- Running outdated/vulnerable versions

**Corrective actions:**
1. **Disable on internet-facing systems:** If a system doesn't need web interface, disable it entirely
2. **Restrict to internal networks:** Use firewall rules to allow only from admin VPNs/bastion hosts
3. **Move to non-standard ports:** Change from 8080 → 18523 (less discoverable)
4. **Require authentication:** All interfaces require MFA-enabled credentials
5. **Use reverse proxy:** Put admin interfaces behind a proxy that adds additional authentication layer

**Example finding:**
```
Vulnerability: VMware ESXi management interface (port 443) exposed to internet
- Port 443 is accessible from any IP
- Default credentials tested (not changed from installation)
- Vulnerable version 6.5 (exploit available)

Corrective action:
  1. Updated ESXi to version 7.0 (out of support, tested first)
  2. Changed default administrator password to 25-character random
  3. Added firewall rule: Allow port 443 only from bastion host 10.0.1.50
  4. Disabled all other admin services (SSH, etc.) on internet side
  5. Enabled vCenter audit logging for all admin access
  6. Tested: External scan shows port 443 closed from internet, admin access only from bastion

Ongoing: Monthly scan of management interfaces from external perspective
```

### Access Control Lists (ACLs) & Network Address Translation (NAT)

**Control:** Network traffic flows only where intended, not to "default allow"

**Problem with defaults:**
- Many firewalls/routers ship with "allow all" as default
- NAT rules forward ports without documentation
- Port mappings accumulate over years (legacy, unused, forgotten)

**Hardening approach:**
1. **Whitelist model:** Default deny, explicitly allow only needed traffic
2. **ACL audit:** Quarterly review of all firewall rules
   - Does this rule still serve a purpose?
   - Is the destination still in use?
   - Could this be more restrictive?
3. **Port cleanup:** Remove unused port mappings
4. **Documentation:** Every rule has a "why" (client ID, service, approval date)

**Example ACL audit:**
```
Firewall review, Q2 2024

Rule: Allow 206.52.103.x (external) → 192.168.1.50 (internal) port 3389 (RDP)
Purpose: Support client XYZ remote access (VPN tunnel)
Status: Client updated to use VPN → remove rule? 
Investigation: Client still has legacy RDP access configured, not in use
Decision: Remove rule (client should use VPN)
Approval: manager@msp.com
Documented: ACL audit log, change ticket CHG-3847

Before cleanup: 214 rules (many redundant, some conflicting)
After audit: 127 rules (rules with clear purpose, less management overhead)
Benefit: Faster rulebase evaluation, fewer conflicts, clearer security posture
```

### Default Credentials Removal

**Control:** No default passwords remain in any system

**Scope:**
- Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Servers (local admin accounts, SQL sa, etc.)
- Applications (WordPress admin, database tools, monitoring dashboards)
- Service accounts (backup software, monitoring agents)

**Process:**
1. **Inventory:** List all systems and their default accounts
2. **Disable/Remove:** Delete or disable default accounts where possible
3. **Change:** For accounts that can't be disabled, change password to 25-character random
4. **Verification:** Attempt login with default credential (should fail)
5. **Documentation:** Maintain list of changed accounts (for troubleshooting, resets)

**Example:**
```
System: Windows Domain Controller
Default account: Administrator (username "Administrator")
Action: Account remains (required for domain), password changed
Old password: [default per Windows]
New password: 7K#mP9$rL@vQ2xW8nB4&zC1*jF6yHt5
Changed by: security@msp.com
Changed date: 2024-03-15
Verified: Attempted login with default password → "Access Denied"
Stored in: Credential vault (HashiCorp Vault, encrypted)
Access to vault: 5 admins (principle of least privilege)
Vault access logged: All retrievals tracked and audited
```

### HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

**Control:** Browsers enforce HTTPS-only communication

**How it works:**
1. Server sends header: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
2. Browser receives header, records it for 1 year
3. For next 365 days, browser will:
   - Automatically convert http://example.com → https://example.com
   - Block access if certificate is invalid (even if user clicks "proceed")
   - Prevent any unencrypted communication

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental http:// connections
- Prevents MITM attacks via downgrade (attacker can't force http://)
- Protects against SSL stripping attacks

**Implementation:**
- Add header to all web applications (web servers, proxies, load balancers)
- Test with browser (HSTS Labs, etc.)
- Start with short max-age (days) during testing, increase to 31536000 (1 year) after verification

**Evidence auditors check:**
- HSTS header present on all HTTPS responses
- max-age value set appropriately
- includeSubDomains enabled
- Browser testing confirms HSTS enforcement

### Logging Enabled & Logs Consumed

**Control:** All security events are recorded and actively analyzed

**What gets logged:**
- Authentication events (logins, failures, MFA challenges)
- Authorization events (permission grants, denials, privilege escalations)
- Configuration changes (any modification to settings or access rules)
- Data access (who accessed sensitive information, when, why)
- Administrative actions (backups, deletions, account changes)
- Security events (failed updates, antivirus alerts, intrusion attempts)

**"Logs consumed" means:**
- Not just written to disk and forgotten
- Actively parsed, analyzed, alerted on
- Reviewed by humans regularly
- Integrated with incident response

**Example logging architecture:**
```
Source systems → syslog/rsyslog → Central ELK Stack → Alerting → SOC review

1. Web server logs HTTP requests → syslog → ELK
   ELK parses and indexes: timestamp, user, action, resource, result
   Alert: 10 failed logins from same IP in 5 minutes → block IP + notify security

2. Firewall logs dropped packets → syslog → ELK
   ELK correlates: Is this a port scan? Is this a known attacker?
   Alert: 100+ packets dropped to port 22 from external IP → review, possibly block

3. Vulnerability scanner finds issue → logged in scanner + ELK
   Alert: Critical vulnerability detected on server X → create ticket, assign to ops

4. Monthly review: Security team searches logs for:
   - Brute force attempts (failed logins from same IP)
   - Insider threats (unusual access patterns)
   - Unpatched systems (requests to deprecated TLS versions)
   - Compliance violations (access without approval)
```

### Principle of Least Privilege

**Control:** Every access is the minimum necessary to do the job

**Applies to:**
- User permissions (file, database, application access)
- Network access (ports, protocols, destinations)
- System resources (CPU, memory, disk quotas)
- Administrative rights (who can change what)

**Implementation:**
1. **Define roles:** What permissions do these job functions need?
   - Support Tech: read-only to customer tickets, reset passwords (limited scope)
   - Network Admin: firewall configuration, but not database access
   - DBA: database administration, but not application code access
2. **Implement RBAC:** Assign users to roles, roles to permissions
3. **Regular review:** Quarterly verification that each user's access matches their role
4. **Just-in-Time (JIT) access:** For sensitive operations, grant temporary elevated access
   - Example: DBA needs to modify production database
   - Request via ticket system, approval required, access granted for 1 hour, logged, access revoked

**Example:**
```
Support technician (user: support1@msp.com) needs access to:
- Read support tickets for their assigned clients
- View client configuration details (to help troubleshoot)
- Reset user passwords (with client approval)
- NOT access: Billing, other clients' data, financial records

Role: "Support Tech - Limited"
Permissions:
  - Ticketing system: Read-only on assigned tickets
  - Knowledge base: Read-only
  - Client portal: View assigned client systems
  - AD: Can reset password in own domain only
  - Database: No direct access (uses web portal)
  - SSH: No access

Review (quarterly):
  Q2 2024: Support1 still assigned 3 clients? Yes, permissions correct
  Q3 2024: Support1 reassigned to 5 clients → role adjusted, test access
  Q4 2024: Support1 promoted to senior support → move to "Support Tech - Full" role

If someone needs temporary elevated access:
  - Ticket: "Need to access client ABC database to debug connection issue"
  - Approval: Manager approves, scope limited to "client ABC database, read-only, 4 hours"
  - Grant: Temporary elevated access via PAM system, logged with timestamp
  - Verify: Can access? Yes, log shows "admin access: 2024-06-20 14:00-18:00"
  - Revoke: Automatic after 4 hours, logged
```

## Continuous Testing Framework

### Monthly Internal Penetration Testing

**Purpose:** Detect vulnerabilities before external attackers do

**Scope:** Varies each month (rotation through systems)
- Week 1: Application layer (web apps, APIs)
- Week 2: Network layer (firewall, NAT, exposed services)
- Week 3: Infrastructure layer (servers, databases, storage)
- Week 4: Access controls (privilege escalation, lateral movement)

**Process:**
1. **Tester given clean environment** (or minimal information like external IP)
2. **Tester attempts to exploit:** All known attack vectors
3. **Findings documented:** Screenshot, steps to reproduce, impact
4. **Results reviewed:** Security team assigns severity (critical, high, medium, low)
5. **Corrective actions assigned:** Who fixes what, by when?
6. **Remediation verified:** Next month's test checks if issue is fixed

**Example findings:**

```
Month 1 (Application Layer):
Finding: SQL injection in customer search form
Impact: Attacker can read all customer data
Severity: CRITICAL
Corrective action: 
  - Parameterized queries for all database access
  - Input validation on all forms
  - Rate limiting on search endpoint
Deadline: 2 weeks
Verification: Month 2 test confirms vulnerability patched

Month 2 (Network Layer):
Finding: Port 8080 open on web server (debug HTTP server)
Impact: Exposed internals if compromised
Severity: MEDIUM
Corrective action:
  - Disabled debug HTTP server in production
  - Closed port 8080 in firewall
  - Verified in staging that application works without it
Deadline: 1 week
Verification: Port scan shows 8080 closed

Month 3 (Infrastructure):
Finding: Weak SSH cipher suite allows weak key exchange
Impact: Potential eavesdropping on SSH sessions
Severity: HIGH
Corrective action:
  - Disabled weak ciphers on all SSH servers
  - Enabled only curve25519 (modern, strong)
  - Tested SSH access from client machines (confirmed working)
Deadline: 1 week
Verification: SSH scan shows no weak ciphers

Month 4 (Access Controls):
Finding: User account in deactivated state but still has firewall access
Impact: Former employee could potentially regain network access if password recovered
Severity: MEDIUM
Corrective action:
  - Automated off-boarding process: disable account, remove from all groups, close firewall rules
  - Quarterly review of deactivated accounts vs firewall rules
  - Revoked any orphaned rules
Deadline: 1 week
Verification: Quarterly review includes this check going forward
```

### External Penetration Testing Cadence

**Frequency varies by industry and risk profile:**
- **Startup, internal-only systems:** Annually (12 months)
- **Small business, minimal customer data:** Semi-annually (6 months)
- **Growing MSP, customer data in scope:** Quarterly (3 months)
- **Regulated industry (HIPAA, PCI):** Monthly or continuous (3-12 months)

**Our MSP approach (25 people, customer infrastructure access):**
- External pen test every 3-4 months (4x/year)
- Includes both network and application testing
- Post-assessment report with findings
- Follow-up verification test (re-test critical findings)

**Cost/benefit:**
- Annual cost: ~$8,000-12,000 (for 4 tests at $2-3k each)
- Benefit: Credibility with customers ("We have regular third-party testing")
- Compliance: Meets SOC2 Type II testing requirements

## Corrective Action Workflow

When a vulnerability is found (internal or external test):

```
1. **Detection & Documentation**
   - Tester reports finding (screenshot, steps, proof of vulnerability)
   - Finding entered in tracking system with unique ID (VULN-2847)
   - Severity assigned (critical, high, medium, low)

2. **Triage & Assignment**
   - Security team reviews finding
   - Is this a false positive? Can we dismiss it?
   - Who owns the fix? (network admin for network issue, dev for code issue)
   - Assigned to owner with deadline based on severity:
     - Critical: 48 hours
     - High: 1 week
     - Medium: 2 weeks
     - Low: 1 month

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Owner investigates: Why does this vulnerability exist?
   - Is it a misconfiguration? Outdated software? Design flaw?
   - How widespread is it? Does it affect other systems?

4. **Remediation Implementation**
   - Owner implements fix (config change, patch, code change)
   - Tested in non-production environment first
   - Change request created, approval obtained
   - Deployed to production in approved change window
   - Tested post-deployment to confirm fix

5. **Verification**
   - Tester re-tests vulnerability in next test cycle
   - Confirms: Vulnerability is gone? Attack vector no longer works?
   - If not fixed, escalate and re-assign
   - If fixed, mark VULN-2847 as resolved

6. **Closeout & Learning**
   - Document: What was the vulnerability? Why did it happen?
   - Process improvement: Can we prevent this in future? (e.g., automated scanning, code review)
   - Log for audit: Evidence that vulnerability was detected and corrected within required timeframe

Example timeline:
  VULN-2847 (Weak TLS cipher) detected: 2024-06-15
  Assigned to: network admin, deadline 2024-06-22 (HIGH severity, 1 week)
  Root cause: Server installed in 2019, TLS config never updated
  Fix: Disabled weak ciphers, enabled TLS 1.3
  Tested: 2024-06-21 in staging
  Deployed: 2024-06-21 22:00 UTC (change window)
  Verified: 2024-07-15 (next month's test confirmed fixed)
  Resolved: 2024-07-15, audit log shows "corrected within SLA"
```

## Why This Matters

Security hardening + continuous testing + corrective action workflow = **provable, sustained security posture**

This approach:
- **Detects vulnerabilities early** (before customer impact)
- **Documents compliance** (logs prove testing happened, issues were fixed)
- **Scales with organization** (automated where possible, disciplined manual processes where not)
- **Builds customer trust** ("We have regular testing and corrective procedures")
- **Meets regulatory requirements** (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST 171 all require this)
