# Portfolio AI Chat

A single-tenant **portfolio RAG chat** at [dev.cwetzel.com](https://dev.cwetzel.com): a React
frontend and a FastAPI proxy on an Ubuntu VPS, talking over an SSH tunnel to vLLM
(Qwen2.5-Coder-14B + pscode LoRA), Qdrant, a CPU embedder and a CPU reranker on a T5810 in a home
office, plus a faithfulness verifier on a second home box.

It is a professional-portfolio showcase running on owned hardware (2x A4500 GPUs, ~400 Mbps
symmetric Verizon FIOS), not a revenue product. An earlier multi-tenant SaaS scope (tenants,
Postgres, JWT/API keys, Stripe billing) was **cut**: its code is on the `legacy/saas-scaffold`
branch and its design docs are in [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/). Nothing in the running system
has a database, an account, or a tenant — so if you find `tenant_id` anywhere, it's archaeology.

**Status:** deployed and in production, on the psplan 5-Gate workflow — Gate 0 (charter, vision,
red-lines, invariants) through Gate 5 (monitoring, closure) are complete for the current scope.

## Core Architecture

```
User Browser
    ↓ HTTPS / WSS
cwetzel.com Cloud Server (Ubuntu VPS)
├─ Apache (SSL termination, reverse proxy, WSS)
├─ FastAPI API proxy (port 8000, systemd: api-proxy.service)
└─ Static React build (/var/www/dev.cwetzel.com/)
    ↓ [SSH tunnel — portfolio-ai-tunnel.service, initiated by the VPS]
T5810 Home Server (Gentoo/OpenRC)
├─ vLLM (port 8004, LAN-only) — Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Pscode, BF16, 16K context
│  └─ 2x RTX A4500, NVLink, tensor parallel
├─ Qdrant (port 6333) — dense 768-d cosine
├─ Embedding service (port 8005) — BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, CPU
├─ Reranker service (port 8006) — bge-reranker-base, CPU
└─ Knowledge base (indexed docs)
    ↓ the same tunnel forwards :8007 → asrock B550 over the home LAN
asrock B550 (Gentoo/OpenRC)
└─ Faithfulness verifier (port 8007) — Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, CPU
```

**RAG pipeline:** query → alias-expand → embed (8005, bge-base 768-d) → Qdrant cosine top-15 →
rerank to top-5 (8006, CPU cross-encoder, ≤1 chunk/doc) → fit to token budget → vLLM stream →
(out-of-band) fire-and-forget faithfulness verify (8007).

The reranker adds precision the bi-encoder can't: cosine surfaces candidates, the cross-encoder
picks the best 5. It runs CPU-only on the T5810's idle 256 GB DDR4, so it never contends with vLLM
for VRAM. It **fails open** to cosine top-5 if the reranker is down; the verifier is fully fail-open
(chat is unaffected if asrock is down).

A deterministic **prompt-extraction guardrail** (`cloud/guardrails.py`) refuses
"reveal/repeat your prompt"-style attacks before they reach the LLM. A **graded eval**
(`scripts/eval_graded.py` + `eval/golden_set.yaml`) gates changes. A **hybrid dense+BM25** path
exists (`HYBRID_SEARCH`) but is **OFF** — an A/B showed it regressed on this small KB (4.41 vs 4.82).

### Known characteristic: the reranker truncates

`bge-reranker-base` caps each (query, chunk) pair at **512 tokens** — an XLM-RoBERTa
`max_position_embeddings=514` limit, not a tunable. The indexer's 400-word chunks tokenize to a
~640-token median, so about 67% of chunks are scored on roughly their first three-quarters. This
affects **ranking only**: `rerank_documents()` returns indices and the caller re-reads the full
payload, so the LLM always receives whole chunks. Widening it means a bigger model (`v2-m3`, 8194
positions, at real CPU cost) or smaller chunks. Measure before changing either.

## Key Features

- **Grounded answers** — every claim comes from the retrieved KB; the model says "I don't have that
  documented" rather than inventing, and the UI shows the exact source chunks it used.
- **Owned GPU inference** — vLLM on 2x A4500s with tensor parallelism. Zero cloud GPU cost.
- **Edge/compute split** — cloud frontend for latency, home GPUs for compute, joined by one SSH tunnel.
- **Out-of-band faithfulness verification** — an independent 7B judge on a separate machine grades
  whether an answer's claims are grounded, without ever blocking the response.
- **Per-message telemetry** — time-to-first-token, decode throughput and total latency under each
  answer (metadata only, never content).
- **Regression-gated** — graded eval, plus a live self-test that `cloud/deploy.sh` runs before it
  finishes.
- **Monitored** — a 5-minute VPS health aggregator, a 30-minute T5810 canary and an external
  healthchecks.io dead-man's switch, all paging via ntfy.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **GPU inference** | vLLM + Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Pscode | LLM serving on 2x A4500s (T5810) |
| **API framework** | FastAPI + Uvicorn | Async Python proxy (cloud server) |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | Dense cosine retrieval, top-15 candidates |
| **Embeddings** | BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (768-d) | Query/document → vector (CPU, port 8005) |
| **Reranker** | bge-reranker-base | Cross-encoder precision, top-15 → top-5 (CPU, port 8006) |
| **Faithfulness verifier** | Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama (CPU) | Out-of-band claim grounding (asrock, port 8007) |
| **Eval / guardrail** | graded eval + golden set; prompt-extraction guardrail | Regression gate + pre-LLM refusal |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + Tailwind | Built + rsynced to dev.cwetzel.com |
| **Reverse proxy** | Apache | SSL termination, static serving, WSS proxy |
| **Networking** | SSH tunnel | VPS → T5810 → asrock (services stay LAN-only) |
| **Chat history** | Browser localStorage | Per-session; nothing persisted server-side |

## Endpoints

The proxy exposes four routes. There is no auth layer — the chat is public and anonymous.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **GET** | `/health` | Liveness, for the health aggregator |
| **POST** | `/api/search` | Debug: retrieve chunks for a query |
| **POST** | `/api/retrieve` | Text-in / chunks-out seam (used by the MCP server) |
| **WS** | `/ws/chat` | Stream a grounded answer, then source + timing metadata |

## Actual Deployment Config

**On the T5810 (Gentoo/OpenRC):**
```bash
# vLLM (OpenRC: pscode-vllm; config /etc/pscode/pscode.conf + /etc/conf.d/pscode-vllm)
MODEL=qwen2.5-coder-14b-pscode   # served-model-name; base Qwen2.5-Coder-14B + pscode-prod LoRA
PORT=8004
TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE=2
GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.93      # 0.95 OOMs; 760 MiB free/A4500 — no room for spec-dec draft

# Qdrant (OpenRC), embed-service 8005 (bge-base, CPU), rerank-service 8006 (bge-reranker, CPU)
QDRANT_PORT=6333
```

**On the asrock B550 (Gentoo/OpenRC):**
```bash
# Faithfulness verifier (OpenRC: verifier-service) + Ollama (OpenRC: ollama)
VERIFIER_PORT=8007
JUDGE_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M   # CPU; independent of the 14B
```

**On the cloud server (cwetzel.com):**
```bash
# API proxy (systemd: api-proxy.service; Apache terminates SSL/WSS in front)
VLLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8004      # via SSH tunnel
QDRANT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6333    # via SSH tunnel
EMBED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8005     # embed-service (tunneled to T5810)
RERANK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8006    # rerank-service (tunneled to T5810)
VERIFIER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8007  # verifier (tunnel → T5810 → asrock); set via systemd drop-in
HYBRID_SEARCH=0                     # hybrid dense+BM25 built but OFF (lost its A/B)
```

**SSH tunnel (single connection, VPS → T5810, with the T5810 as jump host to asrock):**
Forwards 8004 (vLLM), 8005 (embed), 8006 (rerank) and 6333 (Qdrant) — all `127.0.0.1` on the
T5810 — plus **8007 → asrock:8007** (verifier, routed by the T5810 over the LAN). Managed by
`portfolio-ai-tunnel.service` (systemd on the VPS).

## Working On This Repo

**Constraints that bind.** `red-lines.md` and `invariants.md` govern the running system and are
cited from live code. The one that catches people: **never log query or response content** —
metadata only (`red-lines.md` #2). Where `.cursorrules` and `red-lines.md` disagree, red-lines wins.

**The knowledge base must not contain real internal IP addresses.** Public hostnames are fine.

**Retrieval returns ≤1 chunk per source doc** (`RAG_MAX_PER_DOC`). A fact isolated in one chunk may
not surface for a differently-phrased query, so put a corrected fact in the chunk whose topic
matches the likely question — or duplicate it — and verify live with several phrasings.

**Don't hand-patch the Qdrant index.** Rebuild it from the committed KB with `./scripts/reindex_kb.sh`.

**Production actions need explicit authorization** — `cloud/deploy.sh`, `scripts/reindex_kb.sh`, and
any vLLM change. CI deliberately does not deploy.

## Commands

```bash
# Offline unit tests — stdlib-only modules, no live stack needed (this is what CI runs)
python3 -m pytest tests/ home/verifier-service/test_verifier_core.py -v

# Frontend dev server (proxies /ws and /api to localhost:8000)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Full-stack integration test — needs the live stack (proxy, vLLM, Qdrant, embed)
python3 test_rag_system.py

# Graded eval against the golden set (regression gate)
python3 scripts/eval_graded.py

# Deploy: build → rsync → restart → live self-test gate. Requires authorization.
./cloud/deploy.sh

# Rebuild the Qdrant index from the committed KB. Requires authorization.
./scripts/reindex_kb.sh
```

## Documentation Alignment

Docs here describe reality, not aspiration. That took deliberate correction, and the corrections are
worth remembering:

- **2026-06-10** — Aligned docs with the deployed system: React Vite build replaced standalone HTML;
  the model is Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Pscode (never Llama 2 70B); removed multi-tenant references.
- **2026-07-10** — Removed the fictional CI (a workflow that rsync'd deleted `src/`), corrected the
  README's embedder (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` → `bge-base-en-v1.5`, 384-d → 768-d) and reverse proxy
  (Nginx → Apache), rewrote `requirements.txt` to what the code imports (it had listed Stripe,
  SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis), archived the SaaS design docs, and reconciled `.cursorrules` with
  `red-lines.md` — it had instructed agents to log query text.

**When you change the system, change the docs in the same commit.** A wrong doc is worse than a
missing one: it is confidently wrong, and it survives long after the person who knew better moved on.
