# Plan: Verifier Judge Hardening (Task 6)

> The 2026-07 diagnostic proved the faithfulness judge rated a fabricated "40 GB of
> storage" claim as `supported` (row ts 2026-07-04T23:56:06, faithfulness 0.857, not
> flagged). Reading the stored `claims_json` showed this was not one bug but three,
> failing at three different stages. This spec is one coherent diff addressing the two
> that counterbalance each other, and it defers the third deliberately.

## The three breaks (from the live claims_json)

1. **Rubric blessed a paraphrase it shouldn't have.** `JUDGE_SYSTEM` said "A paraphrase of
   a chunk's fact is still supported." The judge treated "20 GB memory and 40 GB of storage"
   as a paraphrase of "40 GB total VRAM" and passed it. A category/unit/role swap is not a
   faithful paraphrase.
2. **Evidence coupling made omissions invisible.** `_fire_verify` was handed the generator's
   own `context_docs`: the reranked set capped at `RAG_MAX_PER_DOC=1`, then token-trimmed.
   For a single-doc-dominant question that means ONE chunk of the very doc that is the
   answer. The judge marked a TRUE asrock fact `unsupported` because the disambiguating
   chunk was never in view. A verifier fed the generator's context shares the generator's
   blind spot: it can catch a claim the shared chunks *contradict*, never one they *omit*.
3. **Extraction missed the worst claim.** "both the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs" was never
   decomposed into a checkable claim, so it was never judged at all. Upstream of entailment.

## Why the fix order is forced

Tightening the rubric on the same thin evidence does not just underperform, it **inverts**
the failure mode: today you get false-supported (the storage pass); a stricter rubric on
one chunk gives false-unsupported at scale, flagging every true claim whose chunk got
capped out. That is worse, because it trains you to ignore flags. So evidence-widening and
rubric-tightening MUST ship together; the stricter rubric needs the wider evidence to score
correctly in both directions. Extraction-widening is the noisy one (more claims, some
false) and goes LAST, against a measured baseline on the tighter rubric.

The asymmetry that makes this safe: widening the *verifier's* evidence is nearly free (the
judge writes no prose, so more chunks only reduce false-unsupported and add contradiction
surface). Widening the *generator's* context is the risky one and stays behind the eval
(that is generator `_cap_per_doc`, tracked separately in the faithfulness plan, NOT here).

## The coherent diff (implemented, uncommitted)

**A. Rubric — `home/verifier-service/verifier_core.py` (`JUDGE_SYSTEM`).**
Removed the blanket "a paraphrase is still supported" clause. Now: `supported` requires the
SAME entities, roles, units, and categories; a changed category/unit/role/grouping is
`contradicted`, not supported, with explicit examples (VRAM called "storage"; CPU called a
GPU; per-item reported as aggregate; one machine's part attributed to another). Because
`compute_verdict` flags on `any(contradicted)` regardless of the 0.8 threshold, a category
swap now forces a flag even in an otherwise high-scoring answer.

**B. Evidence decoupling — `cloud/api-proxy.py`.**
- `rerank_documents(query, payloads)` now returns the FULL reranked list, uncapped. The
  per-doc cap moved out to the caller.
- `search_knowledge_base` returns `(context_docs, evidence_docs)`: `context_docs` =
  `_cap_per_doc(ranked, RAG_TOP_K)` for the generator (unchanged behavior); `evidence_docs`
  = `ranked[:VERIFIER_EVIDENCE_LIMIT]` (15) for the verifier, wide and uncapped.
- `_fire_verify(request_id, query, answer, evidence_docs)` — signature renamed; the judge is
  now fed the wide set, decoupled from the generator's budget in the signature, not sharing
  one object. New constant `VERIFIER_EVIDENCE_LIMIT = 15`.

**C. Fixtures — `home/verifier-service/fixtures.json` (+3, now 8).**
- `category_swap_vram_as_storage` → must flag (the exact live failure).
- `role_swap_cpu_as_gpu` → must flag ("both the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs").
- `true_crossmachine_fact_with_evidence` → must NOT flag: the true asrock fact, WITH its
  chunk present, proving the evidence-widening un-breaks the false-unsupported. The existing
  `paraphrase_still_supported` fixture is the guard that the rubric didn't over-tighten.

## Validation
- Offline: all modules compile; 14 verifier-core + 18 proxy unit tests pass; fixtures parse.
- Live (deploy-gated): `python3 home/verifier-service/run_fixtures.py --url http://<box>:8007`
  against the real Qwen2.5-7B judge. The 3 new fixtures are the ground truth for the rubric
  change; `paraphrase_still_supported` must stay green. This cannot be run offline (needs the
  7B judge); it runs on the asrock after deploy.

## Deferred, on purpose (separate tasks)
- **Extraction widening** — isolate compound claims like "both the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs" so
  they get judged. Noisy; do AFTER a measured baseline on the tighter rubric.
- **Enforcement wiring** — the proxy discards the verifier's return value; a flagged verdict
  is a log row nobody reads. Most urgent operationally and architecturally separate. Minimum
  viable: surface "this answer has a flagged claim" as a non-blocking UI footnote. Does not
  need to block; it needs to be *seen*.

## Guardrails
- No deploy/commit without Chris's go. Generator `_cap_per_doc` stays behind the eval; only
  the verifier's evidence was widened here.
