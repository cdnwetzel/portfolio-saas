# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project:** Portfolio AI SaaS  
**Version:** GATE 1 (Day 30 MVP)  
**Date:** 2026-06-06  
**Scope:** Website launch with AI assistant demo  
**Timeline:** Days 1–30 (GATE 0→5)

---

## Executive Summary

Launch a public portfolio website for Chris Wetzel (IT Manager, 26 years enterprise infrastructure) with an embedded AI assistant that answers questions about his background, expertise, and experience. The AI will be trained on Chris's resume, website content, LinkedIn profile, and case studies. This is a **marketing + demo tool**, not yet a SaaS product.

**Day 30 Deliverable:** `https://cwetzel.com` → AI chat interface showcasing Chris's expertise  
**Post-Launch (60-90 days):** Multi-tenant SaaS platform, knowledge base management, billing  

---

## Problem Statement

Chris's professional background (26 years enterprise IT, 1,948 LinkedIn followers, posts reaching 60,000+ professionals) deserves an interactive showcase. A static website and LinkedIn profile don't convey depth. An AI assistant that can discuss his experience, answer questions, and demonstrate knowledge builds credibility and engagement.

**Audience:** IT managers, consultants, security professionals, recruiters, potential customers  
**Use Case:** "Tell me about Chris's experience with Azure migrations" → AI summarizes his AVD work with specific metrics  

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals (Day 30)
1. ✅ Website publicly accessible on cwetzel.com
2. ✅ AI assistant responding to questions about Chris's background
3. ✅ Latency < 500ms (first token) on 90th percentile
4. ✅ Uptime 99%+ during soft launch (24h monitoring)
5. ✅ Demo is shareable (link someone can click and chat)

### Success Metrics (Measurable)
- **Availability:** Uptime ≥ 99% (measured across soft launch week)
- **Performance:** p90 latency < 500ms, throughput > 50 tok/sec
- **Accuracy:** AI correctly answers >90% of questions about Chris's experience
- **Hallucination rate:** <1% (AI makes up facts <1% of time)
- **User feedback:** Positive response from beta testers (friends, colleagues)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Latency (First Token):** p50 < 100ms, p90 < 500ms
- **Throughput:** > 50 tokens/sec (single-user acceptable, dual GPU available for scaling)
- **Availability:** 99%+ uptime during soft launch week
- **Response Time (Full):** < 10 seconds for 1000-token response

### Security
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS only (no plaintext over internet)
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP, via Redis)
- ✅ No user data persistence (chat history clears on refresh OR cleared daily)
- ✅ Input validation (reject oversized/malformed requests)
- ✅ No secrets hardcoded (env vars for API keys, model path, etc.)
- 🚫 No authentication required (day 30; added in SaaS phase)
- 🚫 No data storage (keep it stateless for MVP)

### Scalability
- **Concurrent users:** 5–10 during soft launch (not enterprise-scale)
- **Queuing:** Simple queue (10 max pending requests, drop if full)
- **Graceful degradation:** If GPU fails, return error (don't hang)
- **Monitoring:** Health check `/health` returns uptime, token usage, GPU util

### Accuracy & Reliability
- **Hallucination rate:** <1% (AI makes up facts < 1% of time)
- **RAG relevance:** Top-5 retrieved documents include answer 90%+ of time
- **Answer coherence:** Responses are grammatical, on-topic, not repetitive
- **Prompt injection:** User cannot manipulate system prompt with input

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| WireGuard tunnel unstable | Medium | High | Monitor continuously, failover to cloud-only mode |
| vLLM inference slow (>500ms) | Medium | High | Optimize batching, reduce context window if needed |
| RAG missing important content | Medium | Medium | Manually test 20+ queries before launch |
| Website styling issues | Low | Low | Test on 3 browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) |
| Domain/DNS issues | Low | High | Test DNS resolution, SSL cert before launch |
| GPU out of memory | Low | High | Set max concurrent requests = 3, queue rest |

---

## Success Definition (Day 30)

✅ **Success:** Website public, AI demo working, shareable with others, no critical bugs during 24h soft launch  
❌ **Failure:** Website not accessible, AI doesn't respond, latency > 1s, crashes during testing

---

- [ ] Billing testing (free tier, paid tier, overage charges)
- [ ] Load testing (50 concurrent users)

### GATE 4-5 (Release & Launch)
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Customer onboarding (first paid customers)
