# Portfolio AI — dev.cwetzel.com

A full-stack AI chat built on personal GPU hardware. Not a wrapper around OpenAI — Qwen 14B runs on two RTX A4500 GPUs in my home office via vLLM tensor parallelism. Every answer is grounded in a RAG knowledge base of documented work: case studies, infrastructure write-ups, LinkedIn posts, resume.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  ↓ HTTPS / WSS
cwetzel.com (Ubuntu VPS)
  ├─ Apache — SSL termination, static React build, WSS proxy
  └─ FastAPI api-proxy (port 8000)
       ├─ RAG: embed query → Qdrant search (top-15) → rerank (top-5) → inject context
       └─ Stream: vLLM WebSocket → browser
            ↓ SSH tunnel
T5810 Home Server (Gentoo Linux)
  ├─ vLLM  — Qwen2.5-Coder 14B, tensor parallel, port 8004
  ├─ Qdrant — vector DB, 768-dim cosine similarity, port 6333
  ├─ bge-base-en-v1.5 — CPU embeddings (768-d), port 8005
  └─ bge-reranker-base — CPU cross-encoder reranker, port 8006
            ↓ same tunnel, routed over the home LAN
asrock B550 (Gentoo Linux)
  └─ Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama — CPU faithfulness verifier, port 8007
```

**Key properties:**
- RAG-grounded responses — model cites sources, says "I don't have that documented" when KB doesn't cover a topic
- Streaming via WebSocket — tokens appear as generated, no polling
- Follow-up suggestion chips — model appends a `FOLLOWUPS:[...]` block; frontend parses and strips it, shows as clickable chips
- Context management — 4K char per-prompt cap, 24K char sliding window history
- Out-of-band faithfulness check — a separate 7B judge on a second machine grades whether each answer's claims are grounded in the retrieved context; fails open, so chat is unaffected if it's down
- Regression-gated — a graded eval over a golden question set (`scripts/eval_graded.py`) runs before deploy, and a deterministic guardrail refuses prompt-extraction attempts before they reach the LLM
- Zero cloud GPU cost — owned A4500 NVLink pair handles inference

## Project Layout

```
cloud/          FastAPI proxy (api-proxy.py) — deployed to VPS
frontend/       React + Vite app — built and rsync'd to /var/www/dev.cwetzel.com/
scripts/        KB indexer (index_with_embeddings.py), one-off tools
knowledge_base/
  RESUME.md
  case_studies/   9 project write-ups (AVD, SAP, SOC2, DR, VMware, AI iterations, ...)
  posts/          Top LinkedIn posts (by impressions)
  infrastructure/ T5810 homelab, this AI system
plans/          Design documents and implementation plans
```

## Running Locally

You need vLLM, Qdrant, an embedding service, and a reranker running. The proxy expects them on localhost ports 8004, 6333, 8005, and 8006 respectively (same as the SSH tunnel forwards in production). The reranker is optional — the proxy fails open to cosine top-5 if port 8006 is unreachable.

```bash
# Frontend dev server
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173 — proxies /ws and /api to localhost:8000

# API proxy
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx
uvicorn cloud.api-proxy:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Index KB into Qdrant (run on whatever machine hosts Qdrant)
python scripts/index_with_embeddings.py
```

---

## Deployment

One script builds the frontend, ships it plus every proxy module, restarts the service, and gates
on a live self-test — deploying the proxy by hand risks leaving its helper modules stale:

```bash
./cloud/deploy.sh
```

## About

Built by Chris Wetzel — infrastructure engineer, 26 years enterprise IT, currently IT Manager at a law firm in NJ. The T5810 running inference in my home office is the same machine I use for Gentoo kernel experiments and the same one I write about on LinkedIn.
